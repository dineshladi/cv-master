industry_positions,TRUE,Analyst,Cognizant Technology Solutions,"Chennai, India",2016,2017,"Project: Ad-Viewership Analytics","Problem: Estimation of ad spend effectiveness for a major US telecom giant.","Solution: Built data pipelines to curate, consolidate and process ad-viewership data across all viewing channels"
industry_positions,TRUE,Analytics Specialist,Opera Solutions,"Delhi, India",2017,2018,"Project: Revenue Management","Problem: Identification of revenue leakage during billing for US healthcare providers.","Solution: Development of an ensemble of Random Forest and Logistic Regression to identify potential revenue items that are missing from a given bill and provide recommendations to the front line accounts.","Benefit: More than 85 % of the recommendations were correct in identifying missed bill items. This led to significant revenue enhancement for the health care providers."
industry_positions,TRUE,Data Scientist,Actify Data Labs,"Bangalore, India",2018,2020,"Project: Crop Classification using Satellite Imagery","Business problem: Classification of various crops using Satellite Imagery","Solution: Built a pipeline to create spectral indices using satellite images, create features on top of the spectral indices, train models and score the models on new satellite images","Benefit: Reduced huge number of man-hours taken to identify and geospatial labeling of crops across various regions in the country. Manual geolabelling of crops for each district takes around 4-5 man hours. Reduced it down to less than 1 hour without compromising precision and recall "
industry_positions,TRUE,Data Scientist, Actify Data Labs,"Bangalore, India",2018,2020,"Product Engineering and Management: Interactive Decision Tree","Developed an interactive drag and drop decision tree tool for segmentation of data for business users. The features include delete, add, cut and copy a subtree from the tree and export the rules to segment the data","Conceptualized, designed and developed the complete product module including algorithm design, UI design and scalability for larger data","The product is sold to one of the cab sharing unicorn in the country"
industry_positions,TRUE,Data Scientist, Walmart Global Tech,"Bangalore, India",2020,2021,"Project:Build Continuous Model Monitoring","Solution: Generate model diagnsotics reports and dashboards to identify anomalous/unexpected performance of models in the system. And also create triggers to create a JIRA ticket whenever the performance of a model is subpar","Benefit: The solution helped in identifying the data drift and model drift"
industry_positions,TRUE,Data Scientist, Walmart Global Tech,"Bangalore, India",2020,2021,"Project: Intent Classification", "Business problem: Improve associate experience while using chatbot","Solution: Build classifiers by finetuning DistilBERT embeddings for intent classification","Benefit: The solution improved the chatbot in identifying the intent of the user"
industry_positions,TRUE,Data Scientist, Walmart Global Tech,"Bangalore, India",2020,2021,"Project: Optimization of bags usage at Walmart stores","Solution: Use bin packing algorithms to identify optimal bags to be used at store checkout counters","Benefit: The solution helped in identifying the stores with high over-usage of bags and keep on check on the same"
industry_positions,TRUE,Data Scientist, Walmart Global Tech,"Bangalore, India",2020,2021,"Project: Curation of Associate Ideas using NLP","Solution: Building a system to filter and group high quality ideas using topic modeling on S-BERT embeddings of user ideas","Benefit: The solution will make sure that the higher management gets high quality distinct ideas that can further reviewed for implementation"
